 The backend architecture of this project, known as OMKA, is based on FastAPI (an async framework for building APIs) and follows Google-style AI/ML engineering standards for reliability, grounding, modularity, and scalability.

The key components of the backend are:
1. STT Service (Speech-to-Text service using Whisper)
2. RAG Service:
   - Embedding Model
   - FAISS Vector Store
   - Retriever
3. LLM Inference Service
4. Monitoring & Metrics

The backend handles API requests, routes queries, manages ML pipelines, and serves streaming responses. (Source: Provided context)
